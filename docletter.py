"Doc here. I've successfully hacked into the TTD, but there's a security protocol that I have set in place."
"Before you can get it to work, you'll need to calabrate and build it."
"It's all part of ensuring the right hands control this powerful tech."
"Get ready from here its up to you and your team to fix the TTD. Only the worthy will succed."
